    <title>Critique of Pacific Trails Resort Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>The Good</h3>
    <h4>Good Layout or wireframe</h4>
    <p>The multi-page site has a similar layout.</p>
    <h4>Good Contrast or Color-Scheme</h4>
    <p>A color pallette was estblished using the homepage image</p>
    <h4>Good Targeting the Audience</h4>
    <p>The target audience is clearly the adventurous kind</p>

    <h3>The Bad</h3>
    <h4>Improve Graphics and Multimedia</h4>
    <p>Static images are nice and would be good as a light background. I think the header images used here might be better improved by the use of gifs or short videos.</p>
    <h4>Improve Use of Text</h4>
    <p>In some places the text seems to run on, while in others there is just one line.</p>
    <h4>Improve Empty Space</h4>
    <p>What will help the text that is used is cleaner spacing between bodies of text, either a line break, or an image, or some other border method</p>


    <h3>The Ugly or rather; What would I improve?</h3>
    <p>I would also use a third party to review spelling and grammar of the page. I would make sure if I am commenting that required fields are marked by an asterisk, that those required fields have an asterisk to mark them. </p>
